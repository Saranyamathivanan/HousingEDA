# HousingEDA
 I have developed EDA for Housing Dataset Ml Project..
 Objective: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Housing dataset to understand the data, relationships, and insights for better decision-making.

Project Steps:

1. Introduction:

The dataset housing.csv contains information about various housing attributes including geographical data, household characteristics, and median house values. This EDA aims to explore patterns, distributions, correlations, and trends within the dataset.

2. Project Plan:

Step 1: Data Loading
 Load the housing dataset and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.

Step 2: Data Exploration
 Perform basic exploratory data analysis including understanding data types, checking for missing values, and descriptive statistics.

Step 3: Data Visualization
 Visualize distributions, relationships, and correlations using charts to gain insights into various attributes.
